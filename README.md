# pyFiniteElements
Finite elements using Python, and only basic (yet extremely powerful) libraries: Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib

This code is provided for educationnal purposes and not created with performance in mind. I will provide simple examples based on my reading on various type of physics and I will try to make them clear enough so they can be easily comprehended and then used by anyone with their own programming logic.

## Electrostatics

Translation to Python3 of the FORTRAN77 example code of: Nathan Ida, Jao Bastos, 1992-1997
