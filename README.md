# pyFiniteElements
Finite elements using Python, and only basic (yet extremely powerful) libraries: Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib

This code is provided for educationnal purposes and not created with performance in mind. I will provide simple examples based on my reading on various type of physics and I will try to make them clear enough so they can be easily comprehended and then used by anyone with their own programming logic.

You can copy paste the codes directly in a Jupyter notebook, and you can then play with the user parameters defined at the beginning of each file.
